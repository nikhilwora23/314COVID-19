# 314COVID-19
The dataset we are trying to use is the CoronaVirus outbreak dataset from 2019-2020. 
The dataset is attached: https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset

Come up with at least 2 hypotheses relevant to your data:
1. Assessment of relations between all patients previously infected with COVID-19 and those that were infected by those previously infected patients.
2. Assessment of relations between those that got tested for COVID-19 and tested negative.
3. Testing for significant difference in the averages of patients who have tested positive
with COVID-19, and patients who have tested negative.

Our data is included in a video presentation that is too big to upload. If interested in watching, email me at nikhilwora@gmail.com and I can email it to you.
